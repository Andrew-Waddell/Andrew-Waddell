<!--
**Andrew-Waddell/Andrew-Waddell** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on becoming more familiar with GitHub and how to use it
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on my bachelor's degree in information systems at The Ohio State University
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a big fan of building Lego Star Wars sets
